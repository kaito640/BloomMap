# ClusterWheel
Visualisation of global / local themes


There is a synthetic theme generator. This the data is ridiculous, but it explains the viz.
In the centre are the themes all clusters care about, the global themes.
In the panels, are the themes that a particular cluster cares about.

This helps visualise the local and global interests. Global governance on global interests.
Locally governed local interests.
