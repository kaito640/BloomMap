# ClusterWheel
Visualisation of global / local themes


There is a synthetic theme generator produced by a bot, so the example test data may be ridiculous, but maybe it explains the point of the visualisation. It has three parts, a global centre, a ring of clusters, and a panel per cluster. 

In the centre are the themes all clusters care about, the global themes.
In the panels, are the themes that a particular cluster cares about.

This helps visualise the local and global interests. Global governance on global interests.
Locally governed local interests.
